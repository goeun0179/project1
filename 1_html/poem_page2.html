      <h1>House by <br />the sea</h1>

      <p class="theysay">
        They say home is the place where your heart is.
      </p>

      <p class="then">
        Then I am home now, though I am far away.<br />For so long I've let the forest guard it.
      </p>

      <p class="and">And now it's begging me to stay. And I'm trying my best to be tough.To pretend I am strong and can siphon it off. But I'm not who I wanted to be In my heart I belong in a house by the sea.
      </p>

      <p class="theysay">
        They say home is a place where you're needed.
      </p>

      <p class="then">
        Then I am home now, but I am leaving.To   feel my feet being kissed by the seaweed.
      </p>

      <p class="and">
        And  I will be silent and kiss it back. This is   not who I want you to see. It's just adding  on weight to the darkness in me. And from the  little I have understood.
        I believe that a house by the sea would do good.
      </p>


      <p class="theysay">
        They say home is a place you can choose to be.
      </p>

      <p class="then">
        And I've decided to carry home inside me<br  />So it's not really as if I am leaving
      </p>

      <p class="and">
        It's more like something pulling meBecause behind everything that I do. I just want to forget, want to carry this throughFill my lungs with the sweet summer air. In my heart, in my mind I am already there
      </p>

      <p class="last">
        Yeah behind everything that I do.
        I just want to come home and lay down beside you. And then I'll be who I wanted to be. In my heart I belong in a house by the sea
